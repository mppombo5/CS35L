1.  man -k [search string]

    commands used:
    man man


2.  mv: /usr/local/cs/bin/mv

3.  139

    commands used:

    find /usr -executable -name "?r" | wc -l (use wc to count the lines of output from the find command)


4.  /etc/alternatives/emacs

    commands used:
    ls -l /usr/bin | grep "emacs" (read the file following "->" at the end)


5.  /usr/bin/gcc: 4.8.5
    plain gcc: 9.2.0
    They are likely different programs because the OS depends on legacy versions of gcc to do certain tasks, so the CS department has given us a more recent version to do our work with.

    commands used:
    /usr/bin/gcc --version
    gcc --version


6.  u+sx means the user will have added permission to execute the file as though it were being run by root; o-w means users not in the group will no longer have permission to write to the file.


7.  commands used:
    man find
    find /usr/local/cs -ctime -28 (-ctime -28 to find files that were last modified less than 28 days ago, or 4 weeks)


8.  253

    commands used:
    which find
    cd /usr/bin
    ls -al | grep -E "^l" | wc -l (used regular expression to find lines that start with l, then pipe that output to wc -l to get the number of symlinks)


9.  librom1394.so.0.3.0

    commands used:
    ls -lt /usr/lib64 (-lt to sort in terms of time from newest to oldest, then just pick the entry at the bottom)

    also got info from the TA's slides.

12. C-M-r: begin reverse incremental regex search
    C-M-s: begin incremental regex search
    C-M-t: switches positions of previous balanced expression and the next
    C-M-u: move up in parenthesis structure
    C-M-v: scroll to the next window
    
    commands used:
    C-h c C-M-r (get command name of key combo)
    C-h F isearch-backward-regexp (command documentation)
    C-h c C-M-t
    C-h F transpose-sexps
    C-h c C-M-u
    C-h F backward-up-list
    C-h c C-M-v
    C-h F scroll-other-window


13. C-g cancels a command in progress before it's finished, whether you typed in a wrong numerical argument or want to stop what's currently running. If you're in the middle of an incremental search, it may take two instances of C-g to stop it.

    commands used:
    C-h c C-g
    C-h F 


14. yank inserts the most recent kill (deleted text) wherever the cursor is, and then place the cursor at the end of the inserted text. The shortcut is C-y.

    commands used:
    C-h F yank


15. ls -l has different (and better) coloring and highlighting for the different kinds of files; dired only seems to highlight symlinks. Another, smaller difference is that in dired, if a listing takes up multiple lines it has a backslash to denote it.

    commands used:
    ls -l /usr/bin
    C-x d /usr/bin
